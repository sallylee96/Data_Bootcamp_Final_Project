Project Description

Over the last fifteen years, there has been rising tension between North Korea versus South Korea and the United States. As North Korea continues to test its missiles and nuclear, the stock, bond and currency markets react to capture the such risks triggered by North Korea. In this project, we will examine how the events arisen by North Korea, including their missile tests and nuclear weapon threats, have affected the South Korean stock, bond and currency markets over the last 14 years (2004 ~ 2017). We will attempt to quantify how much of an effect the North Korean events had over these three markets, and in which circumstance such impact is statistically significant.

There have been similar work in Korea to assess the risks and financial impact triggered by the North Korean events on the South Korean market. What our project differentiates itself from them is that it intuitively quantifies the North Korean incidents by counting the number of New York Times (NYT) coverage in a certain month. Throughout our project, we will attempt to identify and interpret the relationship between the NYT article counts and price movements in the equity, bond and currency markets.
